               <h2>Getting Started: Know Your Zone</h2>
               <p>No matter where you live, you will likely find cucumbers to be one of the easiest vegetables to grow in your garden. You will want to wait about <b>two weeks</b> after the last frost in your USDA zone. If you aren't sure what USDA zone you are in, you can use the <a href="https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/">USDA's interactive map</a> to find out! For example: I am in Southern Illinois, so I am in Zone 6. Knowing your USDA Zone will be integral to having a successful harvest.</p>

               <h2>Planting Your Cucumbers</h2>
               <p>Visit your local garden center or home improvement store to purchase either cucumber seeds or young cucumber plants. The best varieties for pickling will be:<br>
                  &gt; English cucumbers, <br>
                  &gt; gherkins (cornichons), <br>
                  &gt; pickling cucumbers, and <br>
                  &gt; persian cucumbers. <br><br>
               If you are planting seeds directly in your garden (called direct sowing), you should plan to do so within 2 weeks after the last frost in your zone. If you decide to purchase young cucumber plants, you can plant them in your garden as far out as 6 weeks after your zone's last frost. Plant your cucumbers about a foot away from one another; these are vigorous plants that are going to spread very quickly and easily with adequate sun and water. You can plant cucumbers in a garden bed or a large container; just be prepared that most varieties are vining plants, meaning they will need to climb vertically in order to yield the largest harvest. To prepare for aggressive vining growth, purchase some trellis or plant cages for your cucumber plants to climb as they grow.</p>

               <h2>Tending &amp; Harvesting</h2>
               <p>Cucumbers are a generous vegetable, meaning that they will yield a huge harvest with very basic elements of soil, sunlight, and watering. Water your cucumber plants once a day or every other day, depending on rainfall. Within six weeks, you will be plucking 4-5 cucumbers from your plant every few days. I recommend snipping the cucumber at the stem with small garden shears. Be sure to wear gloves when harvesting; pickles grow prickly skin as a protective layer against pests and it can feel cactus-like on bare hands. These spikes will wash off easily when you scrub your cucumbers. Your washed cucumbers will keep in the refrigerator for about two weeks before you'll need to either eat them or begin pickling them.</p>

               <h2>Pickling Supplies</h2>
               <p>There are a few necessary elements to pickling your own cucumbers that you'll need to purchase from your local supermarket: <br>
                  &gt; <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ball-Glass-Mason-Jars-with-Lids-Bands-Wide-Mouth-Clear-16-oz-12-Count/16213254">wide mouth jars, </a> <br>
                  &gt; a large stock pot, <br>
                  &gt; vinegar, <br>
                  &gt; <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Morton-Canning-Pickling-Salt-for-Preserving-and-Pickling-4-lb-Box/10318924">canning salt, </a><br>
                  &gt; sugar and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SPICES-VILLAGE-Pickling-Spices-All-Natural-Fresh-Dried-Mix-Pickles-Canning-Corn-Beef-Seasoning-Blend-Kit-Kosher-Gluten-Free-Non-GMO-Resealable-Bulk-B/672241584">pickling spices. </a> <br><br>
                  You can often find pre-made pickling spices in the same aisle as the jars; otherwise, Google searching will return plenty of delicious spice recipes for you to try out! You can also add other fresh ingredients to your pickle jars for added flavor, like onion, garlic, and dill sprigs. In order to make the pickling brine, you'll also need some salt and sugar.</p>

               <h2>Jar &amp; Store Your Pickles</h2>
               <p>Unlike cooking or baking, jarring and preserving your garden harvest is extremely simple, and has plenty of room for error. <br><br>
                  &gt; <b>Step 1.</b> First, you'll want to be sure to boil (a.k.a. sanitize) your pickling jars before filling them. This will prevent bacteria from growing inside the jars as your pickles age on the shelf. <br><br>
                  &gt; <b>Step 2.</b> Begin simmering your brine, a combination of water, vinegar, spices, salt, and sugar. <br><br>
                  &gt; <b>Step 3.</b> While that's simmering, slice your cucumbers any which way you'd like to: sandwich slices (long and thin), hamburger pickles (typically small circles cut with a wavy knife), spears, or you can pickle them whole if you've grown a smaller variety, like cornichons. <br><br>
                  &gt; <b>Step 4.</b> Pack your cucumbers into the clean jars (pack as tightly as possible, as the brine will cause them to loosen in the jar over time). Let your brine cool to warm, and pour into your jars. This may take some trial and error with amounts; you may have too many cucumbers or not enough for the brine; that's okay! Either make more brine if you need to fill more jars, or keep any leftover brine in the refridgerator until you have more cucumbers ready to be pickled. <br><br>
                  &gt; <b>Step 5.</b> Tightly screw the lids on your jars, and boil them in a stock pot for 10 minutes, which will "seal" the lid and make the pickles shelf stable for up to a year!</p>

               <p>Here you can see that my cucumbers grow faster than I can pickle them, most years! When I slow down on pickling, I use my excess cucumbers in salads, wraps, and as a fresh, healthy snack!</p>
